There are various kinds of games hosted in the cyber arena that you can compete in. This means that it is not only the sharpest blades that decide the winner. The games that take place in the arena come in form of one of the following challenges:
1. PVP fights within the given time limits
2. Obstacle courses
3. Puzzles to be solved
4. Slam battles

You can take part in each of the challenges either individually, or in teams. The following formations are possible:
|Number of players in a single team|Number of teams|Total number of players|
|--|--|--|
|1|2|2|
|2|2|4|
|3|2|6|
|4|2|8|
|1|8|8|
|2|4|8|
|4|4|16|

The map for each of the challenges as well as the setting of the challenge itself will be rearranged every month so that there is not a single player that is better adapted to the challenge than everyone else.

Finally, everyone will be able to practice without risking one's finances or stats. For this purpose, there will be special areas on the map designed to act as practice arenas. You should not expect, however, the practice arenas to prepare you for everything that you might run into upon entering the main arena as the arrangement of the practice arenas and the main arena is guaranteed to always be slightly different.
