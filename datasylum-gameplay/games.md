The map for each of the challenge as well as the setting of the challenge itself will be rearranged every month so that is not going to be a single player that is better adapted to the challenge that everyone else.

Finally, everyone will be able to practice without risking one's finances or stats. For this purpose there will be special areas in the map designed to act as practice arenas. You should not expect the practice arenas to prepare you for everything that you might run into upon entering the main arena, however, as the arrangement of the practice arenas and the main arena is guaranteeed to always be slightly different.
