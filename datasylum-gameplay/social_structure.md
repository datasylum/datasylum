The social world of Datasylum is structured by a strict social hierarchy that consists of five levels (ordered from the highest to lowest):
1. **Caesar Machina** (the ruling class)
2. **Mana Logico** (the minister class)
3. **Proxy Visgard** (the guardian class)
4. **Freedmen** (the middle class)
5. **Data Slaves** (the enslaved class)

Climbing the ladder of social hierarchy is the ultimate goal of the game. The main means of proving one's worth is participating in the games that take place in the main arena of cybergladiators.

All players start at the bottom of the social structure of Datasylum, i. e. as data slaves. Each victory as well as active participation in the world of Datasylum allows you to earn social points which will get you up the ladder of social hierarchy. 

There are predefined requirements for reaching the next social stratum in terms of victories. In order to free yourself from the status of Data Slave and reach the level of *Freedmen* you have to win 8 fights in the arena, whereas to become *Proxy Visgard* you not only need a total of 16 wins, but also a 4 win streak. Reaching the status of *Mana Logico* requires a total of 64 games won as well as an 8 win streak. Finally, there's the status of *Caesar Machina* which will prove to be out of reach for most as it requires a total of 128 games won and a streak of 16 consecutive wins. The requirements for reaching each of the levels are summarized in the table below

|Status|Wins|Win streak|
|--|--|--|
|**Data Slave**|-|-|
|**Freedman**|8|-|
|**Proxy Visgard**|16|4|
|**Mana Logico**|64|8|
|**Caesar Machina**|128|16|

{% hint style="info" %}
There can only be one **Caesar Machina* in the game. In the case there are two players that meet the requirements for *Caeser Machina*, the title is granted to the one who has a higher win rate.
