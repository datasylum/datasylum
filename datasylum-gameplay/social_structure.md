# Social structure

The social world of Datasylum is structured by a strict social hierarchy that consists of five levels (ordered from the highest to lowest):

1. **Caesar Machina** (the ruling class)
2. **Mana Logico** (the minister class)
3. **Proxy Visgard** (the guardian class)
4. **Freedmen** (the middle class)
5. **Data Slaves** (the enslaved class)

Climbing the ladder of social hierarchy is the ultimate goal of the game. The main means of proving one's worth is participating in the games that take place in the main arena of cyber gladiators.

All players start at the bottom of the social structure of Datasylum, as **data slaves**. Each victory as well as active participation in the world of Datasylum allows you to earn social points which will get you up the ladder of social hierarchy.

In order to free yourself from the status of Data Slave and reach the level of _Freedmen_ you have to win 8 fights in the arena, whereas to become _Proxy Visgard_ you not only need a total of 16 wins, but also a 4 win streak. Reaching the status of _Mana Logico_ requires a total of 64 games won as well as an 8 win streak. Finally, there's the status of _Caesar Machina_ which requires a total of 128 games won and a streak of 16 consecutive wins. The requirements for reaching each of the levels are summarized in the table below
