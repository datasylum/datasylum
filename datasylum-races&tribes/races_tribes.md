# Races & Tribes

Datasylum is populated by 3 races.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
* **Pura**: Pura's DNA has never been affected by gene engineering or biotechnology. As the practice of biohacking become so widespread, Puras are considered rare species and are generally regarded with respect (if not slight jealousy). While Puras might be seen as disadvantaged in comparison to their technologically-enhanced adversaries, technological interventions deprive one of the certain faculties that only Puras can possess. The intuition special to Puras, however, does not come as given and it is only through the simulation that it can be unwrapped.
* **Genoma**: The technological interventions followed by the deprivation of the human faculties are exemplified by Genoma. The great-grandfathers of Genomas were the first to experiment with CRISP-CAS technology. As a result, Genomas are half-human and half-animal. While the genetic material of an animal significantly enhances their bodies, it has left their minds severely handicapped.
* **Biomeka**: Biomekas constitute the largest part of the Datasylum's population. When a rich Genoma or Pura dies, its mind is uploaded to the cloud which is to be eventually installed into a biological machine. Thus a Biomeka is born. Despite their mechanical constitution, some Biomekas still possess some human-like features. Some, however, cannot be said to have ever roamed in a human form.

All three races have come to adopt some political form and thus divided into respective factions.

**Pura**&#x20;

Considering the information that has been collected, we know that Puras belong to one of the following:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* **Seo Neta**: Puras who have been successful in developing their natural faculty of intuition. Through the generations, Seo Netas have shaped their intuitions in a way that allows them to access other people's memories. Reaching such ability, however, marks the highest point of a life of a Seo Neta as it can only be developed through years of expensive training. As a result, Seo Netas are naturally inclined to accumulate material wealth and reach for the highest strata of society.
* **1047** The name of the tribe derives from a historical event when 1047 innocent civilians have been slaughtered during an unlawful caesar re-election. They have decided to adopt the name as a reminder that laws do not determine what is good. The facial traits of 1047s make them look good-natured as well as rather naive. This outer appearance, however, is misleading as the shared memory was what made 1047 accumulate resources and equip themselves should the memories be brought back alive. Seo Netas look down on them as they believe that the efforts of 1047 have been misguided. Seo Netas believe that the natural faculty of intuition that 1047 are possessed with is being wasted and for this reason considers 1047 a liability to the dominion over Puras by other races.

**Genoma**&#x20;

The task of collecting information on Genomas has proved to be a difficult task, but this is what we know so far. The remains of human in Genomas is what is responsible for different beliefs that the existing fractions hold:

* **Mokba**: The same reasons that make the data collection difficult are characteristic traits of Mokbas: they find shelter in the wilderness of the outskirts of Datasylum. There is a strong belief shared by Mokba's that it is their dedication to their ideals and the adoption of the primitive lifestyle that makes them overall superior race on Datasylum. The strong muscle tissue of what remains to be human flesh in Mokbas is the result of their living environment. However, in addition to the effects that technological interventions had on Mokbas minds, life outside the city has also deprived them of the situations requiring multi-tasking and performing well under stress. As a result, the nervous and chemical distribution system in Mokbas is underdeveloped. Unless they were triggered by a ruler of Datasylum deciding to take control of wilderness (which would be considered political trespassing according to Dagata), Mokbas have generally no ambition to rule Datasylum.
* **Helix NRA**: As opposed to Mokbas, NRAs do not believe the way of a recluse to be the solution. Instead, they believe that if Genomas are to reorganize themselves under the agenda set by NRAs, Genomas would be able to take over Datasylum thus removing the risk of a ruler who's not good-willed towards Genomas altogether. NRA's also believe that Dagata is what impoverished Genomas. However, as long as Dagata continues to play the role among Mokbas, NRAs believe that they can use Dagata's influence to their benefit.

* **MINIAC** Called after the name of the company which first launched the DNA & memory transplant technology, MINIACs are united in the belief that their extended existence as Biomekas is great work of art. This idea alone is enough for MINIACs to instead seek peaceful coexistence with other races. The benefit of hindsight makes MINIACs disposed towards the promotion of gatacultural diversity among the lesser forms of existence even if such diversity cannot be secured by peaceful means. MINIACs place great emphasis on visual esthetics as something that goes in accord with their status as a crowning technological achievement.
* **Solar s0x** These Biomekas are a version of biological machines offered to Puras and Genomas nearing their expiry purely for agonistic and hedonistic experiences. Due to their technological advantage, s0xes tend to transmit narcissistic optimism. The competitive advantage combined with the urge for luxury is the drive that makes the possibility of ruling Datasylum for s0xes nothing but another kick.
